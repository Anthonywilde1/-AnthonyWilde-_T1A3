# 21st of April	

1st half of the the day was spent finishing up the planning of the app with the usage (See ReadMe.md and also https://trello.com/b/bahzwBP9/coding-life) After that I had to get my files in order for GitHub which included making a repository and then having to make myself  a SSH key tied to my terminal on my virtual machine. Finally after sorting all of that I got to get cracking on some code. I wrote up the character file then wrote up test about the initialise part of the character class. I then wrote some code for the main attempting to break it down into methods to make the code dry. 
May create a smaller file of the main game with everything in it linking to relative files for Dryness.

Managed to tick several boxes today.
